# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Use this folder to capture significant technical decisions with lightweight
ADRs. Naming convention: `NNNN-short-title.md` where `NNNN` is a zero-padded
sequence (for example, `0001-choose-message-digest.md`).

Suggested workflow:

- Copy `0000-template.md` to a new file with the next sequence number.
- Fill in title, status, context, decision, consequences, and references.
- Keep one decision per ADR; link related ADRs to each other.
- Commit ADRs with code changes they justify when possible.
